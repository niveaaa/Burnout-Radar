# 🧠 Burnout Radar

**Burnout Radar** is a student-focused wellness and workload monitoring system designed to detect early burnout signals, explain their causes, and visualize academic pressure in a calm, non-judgmental interface.

This project is **not a motivation app**. It is an **early-warning and awareness system** that helps students understand pressure before it turns into burnout.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Burnout Radar helps college students:

- Visualize workload and pressure clearly
- Understand *why* burnout risk is increasing
- Take early, informed action before performance and mental health decline

The focus is **clarity over motivation** and **control over guilt**.

---

## 🔐 User Data Handling & Privacy

- Each user has a **separate local JSON file**
- Data is written **only when the user clicks Save**
- No background auto-saving
- No cross-user overwrites
- Firebase is used for:
  - Cloud persistence
  - Analytics
  - Demo credibility

The system is designed to respect user control and consent.

---

## 🧠 Burnout Score Logic (High-Level)

Burnout is calculated using weighted, non-linear factors:

- Sleep debt
- Screen time overload
- Task and deadline pressure
- Mood decline

Extreme behavior (very low sleep, excessive screen time) is penalized more heavily than small fluctuations, making the score more realistic and sensitive.

---

## 🤖 AI Explanation Flow

### Inputs
- Sleep duration
- Screen time
- Task load
- Mood rating
- Optional user-written stress context

### Processing
- Data is sent to Google Gemini
- Context-aware reasoning is applied

### Output
- Explanation of burnout level
- Key contributors
- Practical, realistic suggestions

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install streamlit firebase-admin google-api-python-client google-auth google-auth-oauthlib google-generativeai
```

---

### 2️⃣ Set Environment Variables (AI)

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
setx GEMINI_API_KEY "your_gemini_key"
```

---

### 3️⃣ Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

### 4️⃣ (Optional) Run HTML Dashboard

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open in browser:
```
http://localhost:8000/index.html?user=simi
```

---

## ⚠️ Design Decisions

- ❌ No auto-saving → avoids noisy, inaccurate data
- ❌ No iframe messaging → avoids browser security issues
- ❌ No cross-origin hacks → avoids CORS failures
- ✅ Manual save → user control
- ✅ Local JSON → instant dashboard updates
- ✅ Firebase → persistence and credibility

Built to **work reliably under hackathon pressure**, not to look clever and fail.

---

## 📌 Future Improvements

- Proper authentication (OAuth / Firebase Auth)
- Multi-day history per user
- Burnout prediction (next-day / next-week)
- AI response caching
- Report export (PDF)
- Mobile app wrapper
