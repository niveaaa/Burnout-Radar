# 🧠 Burnout Radar

**Burnout Radar** is a student-focused wellness and workload monitoring system designed to detect early burnout signals, explain their causes, and visualize academic pressure in a calm, non-judgmental interface.

This project is **not a motivation app**. It is an **early-warning and awareness system** that helps students understand pressure before it turns into burnout.

---

## 🎯 Project Objective

Burnout Radar helps college students:

* Visualize workload and pressure clearly
* Understand *why* burnout risk is increasing
* Take early, informed action before performance and mental health decline

The focus is **clarity over motivation** and **control over guilt**.

## 🔐 User Data Handling & Privacy

* Each user has a **separate local JSON file**
* Data is written **only when the user clicks Save**
* No background auto-saving
* No cross-user overwrites
* Firebase is used for:

  * Cloud persistence
  * Analytics
  * Demo credibility

The system is designed to respect user control and consent.

---

## 🧠 Burnout Score Logic (High-Level)

Burnout is calculated using weighted, non-linear factors:

* Sleep debt
* Screen time overload
* Task and deadline pressure
* Mood decline

Extreme behavior (very low sleep, excessive screen time) is penalized more heavily than small fluctuations, making the score more realistic and sensitive.

## ▶️ How to Run the Project

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

### 2️⃣ Environment Configuration (.env)

Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following contents:

```env
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key_here
```

Make sure this file is **not committed to version control**.

---

### 3️⃣ Firebase Configuration (Service Account)

This project uses **Firebase Firestore** for cloud data persistence.

To enable Firebase access:

1. Create a Firebase project from the Firebase Console.
2. Generate a **Service Account key** from:
   Project Settings → Service Accounts → Generate new private key
3. Download the JSON file and place it in the project root as:

```text
firebase_key.json
```

---

### 4️⃣ Run the Streamlit App

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

---

### 5️⃣ (Optional) Run HTML Dashboard

```bash
python -m http.server 8000
```

Open in browser:

```
http://localhost:8000/login.html
```

## 📌 Future Improvements

* Proper authentication (OAuth / Firebase Auth)
* Multi-day history per user
* Burnout prediction (next-day / next-week)
* AI response caching
* Report export (PDF)
* Mobile app wrapper
